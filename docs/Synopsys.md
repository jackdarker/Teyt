#DLCSeason

As a student at ITD you struggle to keep up with your studys and making friends with your fellow comrades. An offer for taking part in a beta test of a roleplaying game is just the divertion you desired right now. Its a virtual reallity-game in a fantasy setting and you will get state of the art VR-equipment for free - how could you not wanna try this !

...
The game is split up in 2 parts:
- the real-life part where you have to study, work on a job, interact with 'normal' people (boring humans)
- the VR game where you have to explore, solve quests, defend yourself or get.. uhm... punished. 
- You might find some similiaritys to healslut, CoC,Lustful desire, liliths throne... 
- the 2 parts are interlinked with each other but the primary focus is the VR-experience
- transformations are mostly done in the VR-game. I mean, how believabe would it be to get a lycanthropy curse from a game. Thats really unlikely, nearly impossible...nearly.
- at times, the game runs in freeplay mode (where you can roam freely and do as you like). At the beginning the options to choose from are more limited to guide the player through some tutorials.

This game isn't for you if:
- you dont like (or at least tolerate) Anthro-furries, scalies and such things. Or animals.
- you expect a quick-start with MtF/sissification
- you dont want turn-based combat
- you need porn-videos or images to survive. I would love to add some juicy pics but its hard to get some free ones for anthros.
- you need regular updates. I'm doing this in my freetime and it progress is SSSSLLLOOOOWWWWW. 

Be aware: I'm not a writer and english isn't my first language.
AND I dont like games with walls of text. So - no walls of text (at most times).
Also, I'm not an artist. So no fancy pics right now.
Here again, my goal is to build a nice freeplay mode instead of an awesome writen CYOA.

The current state of the game:
- a bunch of RL&VR-passages are there, also some beginnings of quests. But I wont even say its something like a 1.chapter.
- I'm still working on the engine-code before adding more content
- not much tf-content right now. Sizechanges at most.
- no sex (its still XXX-rated beause I will add some - there has to be some)
- no freeplay
- expect some instabilities; save games might break
- the corner stones of the story arc needs to be...uhm..found. I have some ideas, but they are still vaguly sizeable. 

How can you help:
- there will be no patron where you can drop your money in.
- there is currently no bug-tracker setup. Please add comment in Game Releases.
- maybe you have some ideas for quests. Please add comment in Game Releases.
